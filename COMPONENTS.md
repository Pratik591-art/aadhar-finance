  <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
  <Route path="/contact" element={<ContactPage />} />
</Routes>
```

### Modifying Components

Each component is self-contained in `src/components/`. Simply edit the component file to customize:
- Styling (Tailwind classes)
- Content (text, images, data)
- Behavior (event handlers, state)

### Updating Partner Data

Edit the arrays in `src/components/PartnersSection.jsx`:
```jsx
const lendingPartners = [
  {
    name: 'Partner Name',
    type: 'NBFC',
    interestRate: '10.5% onwards',
    // ...more fields
  }
];
```

### Changing Theme Colors

Update Tailwind config in `tailwind.config.js` or modify classes directly in components.
